# CS300-Coursework
### What were the problems that you were solving in this course?
The main problem that we encountered througout this course was the insertion, organization, and presentation of computer science courses.
Many of the problems that we encountered throughout the lifespan of this course were mainly to do with
how many data structures work for many different operations.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by breaking it down into its basics. What were the most important operations that needed to be done?
Which data structure would be ideal for this most important operation? It was more about breaking down the problem itself'
in order to make things more manageable and easier to understand. Data structures are very important, because they each
serve their own unique purpose and can come in handy for their given scenario, it is not a 'one size fits all' kind of thing.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame many roadblocks throughout the course by referring to reference material, whether these be within the course or not. 
The main hurdle was getting used to using a lower level language like C++, as I come from a Javascript background.
Looking back at materials provided in this course, especially the textbook, provided a solid foundation for approaching problems.
Outside of this, online resources like StackOverflow proved themselves to be indispensable throughout this course.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work conducted throughout this project has provided me with some much needed background information on data structures
and the fundamentals of coding in general. Since I mostly work with Javascript, I have gotten accustomed to adopting
and using a mentality aligned with 'learn how to use it before you learn how to understand it'. This has gotten me 
to be able to work effectively and achieve results, but it leaves me with a sense of curiosity surrounding the tools and 
frameworks I work with. This lower level language run on data structures gave ma a better look at how data structures 
interact with memory and how they perform under certain circumstances.

### How has your wortk on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work I have done on this project has adapted the way I write code, because it made me more aware of how code works in general.
The work I have done throughout this project has made me more aware of the impact many coding practices I follow today have on 
the development lifecycle.
